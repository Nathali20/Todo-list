# Test technique

# **A Todo-List application**


**Project Description**

This application was about to create a simple todo list, the user must be able to **Create**, **Modify**, **Delete** and **Read** all his tasks.



**Technologies used** 

  To perform this technical test, I used various technologies : 

  Front-end: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** et **Bootstrap** 
  
  Back-end: **Symfony**, **MySQL** (database). 





**Installation of the framework and its dependencies**

Install the Symfony free software platform with its dependencies [via this link](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html), create your application and get into in your application's directory to start:

    symfony new [project_name] --webapp

    cd [project_directory]

In the project directory, you will have to run :  
    
    composer require webapp

 
**Run the program** 

In the project directory, to start your application you will have to run:  
    
    symfony server:start

this command runs the app in the development mode. You can access it by using https://localhost:8001 to view it in your browser.
